drawback of insertion sort is the amount of shifting
if the array was an almost sorted array, the time complexity would be almost linear
shell sort is therefore an improvement over insertion sort

insertion sort uses a gap value of 1
shell sort starts off by using a larger gap value

as the algo runs, the gap is reduced, until the last iteration has gap = 1
the algo does preliminary work until it becomes insertion sort
the preliminary work makes the elements closer to their sorted positions

knuth sequence is a popular sequence where gap = (3^k - 1)/2
we will use gap = array.length/2 and divide it by 2 in all consecutive iterations

It is an UNSTABLE sort
